# Algorithms :brain:
These are some basic algorithms I've tried to recreate on my own.

## About :memo:
The algorithms presented here:
- linear search;
- binary search (using both non-recursive and recursive solutions);
- selection sort;
- bubble sort (the favorite one because of the name :zany_face:) ;
- quick sort (that wasn't so quick as the name says :sweat_smile:).

Also I want to pay your attention on linear search, because it has one cool feature of object search as you can see.


## Stack :woman_technologist:
- JavaScript 

## What I really like :sparkles:
The part where i was watching hungarian folk dance videos on YouTube explaining basic algorithms. 
Now you can be absolutely sure that I know what is actually going on every time when a computer sorts!

Special thanks go to my mentor and best friend [Mishanya](https://github.com/OUghTMS/). All of that wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for him.

P.S. Cool object search feature in the linear search was his briliant idea !!!
